# The Human Source Code Project
## Goal
The goal of the project is to help reverse-engineer the human genome to allow us to understand the code behind it, letting us program-in, arbirtrary changes and features (using CRISPR), giving a computer software like flexbility and documentation to DNA.
## Current Project Method
The current method that will be being tested is by means of assigning relevant high-level categories to the genomes of organisms we have fully sequenced, and running the resulting vector data set through a machine learning algorithm - specfically TensorFlow. This should allow us to identify connections, patterns and mechanisms we've been unable to understand or even discover, to-date.
